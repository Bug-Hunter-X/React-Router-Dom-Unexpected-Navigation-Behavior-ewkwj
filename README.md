# React Router Dom Unexpected Navigation Behavior

This repository demonstrates a bug in React Router Dom where navigation between routes does not always work as expected.  Sometimes links will fail to render the correct component, resulting in a blank screen or the incorrect page being displayed.

## Bug Description

The issue is intermittent, but when it occurs links between routes using `react-router-dom`'s `<Link>` component may fail to navigate correctly. This can manifest as a blank screen, unexpected routing, or the application remaining on the current page. The bug is demonstrated in the `bug.js` file.

## Solution

A potential solution is presented in `bugSolution.js`. This solution involves ensuring proper route configurations, checking for errors in the route definitions, and verifying that the component rendering logic is correct. Detailed explanation can be found in the file comments.
